# Fluency-Net

A real-time, AI-powered speech therapy assistant designed to help users improve fluency. This application uses advanced speech-to-speech technology to analyze stuttering patterns, provide therapeutic feedback, and generate fluent audio/video output.

Speech-language disorders, particularly stuttering, affect millions of individuals globally, often leading to communication anxiety and limited access to consistent professional therapy. While modern speech technologies have advanced significantly, most Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are designed to "clean" or "normalize" speech, effectively removing the very dysfluencies (blocks, prolongations, and repetitions) necessary for therapeutic analysis. This project introduces Stutter2Fluent, an autonomous, real-time AI Vocal Agent designed to bridge the gap between clinical speech-language pathology and accessible technology.

**Keywords:** Generative AI, Speech-Language Pathology, Large Language Models (LLMs), Multilingual ASR, Speech Synthesis, SOAP Notes, Stuttering Detection

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-Time Streaming**: Low-latency speech analysis using WebSockets and AudioWorklet.
- **Multilingual Support**: Provides focused support for English, Hindi, and major South Indian languages (Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam).
- **AI Analysis**: Uses **Ollama (Llama 3.1)** and **Agno** to detect stuttering types (Repetitions, Blocks, Prolongations) and provide clinical SOAP notes.
- **Adaptive Agentic Workflow**: Implements a stateful reflex agent that dynamically adjusts therapy goals (e.g., switching from "Fluency Shaping" to "Anxiety Reduction") based on real-time user performance metrics.
- **Fluent Regeneration**: Reconstructs fragmented speech into fluent text and audio using **Kokoro TTS** (High Quality) or **Edge TTS**.
- **Acoustic Features**: Analyzes RMS Energy and Zero Crossing Rate to detect physical tension and struggle behaviors.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12** (Python 3.13+ is currently incompatible with `faster-whisper`).
2. **FFmpeg**: Required for video processing.
    - Windows: `winget install Gyan.FFmpeg`
    - Mac: `brew install ffmpeg`
    - Linux: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
3. **Ollama**: Required for the AI Agent logic.
    - Download from ollama.com.
    - Pull the model: `ollama pull llama3.1:8b`

4. **eSpeak NG**: Required for phonemization by the local English TTS (Kokoro).
    - Windows: Download and run the `.msi` installer from the eSpeak NG GitHub releases.
    - Mac: `brew install espeak-ng`
    - Linux: `sudo apt install espeak-ng`

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd Stutter2Fluent
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (Recommended)

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # Mac/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Run the Setup Script**
    This script installs Python dependencies and downloads necessary AI models (Kokoro ONNX).

    ```bash
    python download_requirements.py
    ```

4. **Start Ollama**
    Ensure Ollama is running in the background.

    ```bash
    ollama serve
    ```

## ▶️ Running the Application

Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
python main.py
```

- The application will launch at `http://localhost:8000`.
- If port 8000 is busy, you can change it by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

You can run the entire stack (App + Ollama) using Docker Compose.

1. **Build and Start Services**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

2. **Download the AI Model** (First time only)
    Since the Ollama container starts empty, you need to pull the model:

    ```bash
    docker exec -it fluency-net-ollama ollama pull llama3.1:8b
    ```

3. **Access the App**
    Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `main.py`: Core backend logic (FastAPI, WebSocket, Audio Pipeline).
- `index.html`: Frontend UI (Bento Grid design, Audio Recording, Streaming).
- `download_requirements.py`: Helper script for setup.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependency list.
- `temp/`: Stores temporary audio/video files during processing (auto-cleaned).

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can configure the application using environment variables or a `.env` file:

- `OLLAMA_HOST`: URL of the Ollama server (default: `http://127.0.0.1:11434`).
- `PORT`: Port to run the web server on (default: `8000`).

## 🧠 How It Works

### System Architecture

1. **Multimodal Ingestion**: Fuses **Faster-Whisper** transcripts with raw acoustic data (RMS Energy, ZCR) to detect non-verbal "blocks" that text-only models miss.
2. **Stateful Agent Brain**: Uses `AgentInternalState` to track conversation history and emotional trajectory. The system employs a **Goal-Based Strategy** engine that evaluates the success of previous interventions before selecting the next therapeutic tactic.
3. **Local-First Inference**: Runs entirely on-device using **Ollama** and **Int8 Quantization**, ensuring patient data privacy and zero cloud latency.
4. **Generative Synthesis**: Reconstructs fluent speech using **Kokoro TTS** (ONNX) for natural prosody restoration.

3. Algorithms & Techniques
Speech Processing:

Beam Search Decoding: Used in Whisper (beam_size=5) to explore multiple transcription paths, crucial for accuracy in agglutinative languages like Telugu.
Voice Activity Detection (VAD): Filters out silence using energy thresholds (min_silence_duration_ms=2000) to focus processing on active speech.
Autocorrelation: Used in extract_acoustic_features to estimate the Fundamental Frequency (Pitch/F0) of the voice.
Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR): Algorithm to calculate the noisiness of the signal, helping detect fricative sounds (s, sh, f).
Root Mean Square (RMS): Calculates the average power (loudness) of the audio signal.
AI & LLM Techniques:

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting: The system prompt instructs the LLM to output <thought> tags before the JSON, forcing it to reason step-by-step before generating the final analysis.
Few-Shot Learning: The prompt includes specific examples (Input -> Output pairs) for multiple languages to "teach" the model the expected behavior.
Heuristic Language Detection: A custom algorithm that combines Whisper's detection, langdetect library, and script analysis (Latin vs. Non-Latin ratio) to accurately identify the language.
Software Engineering:

Dependency Injection: Used via FastAPI's Depends (implicit in route handlers).
Caching Strategy: TTS audio is cached using an MD5 hash of text + voice + speed to prevent redundant processing.
Retry Logic: Implemented in knowledge_agent_client to handle transient LLM failures.
4. Key Functions & Methods
process_audio_pipeline: The central orchestrator that manages the flow from Audio Upload -> Transcription -> AI Analysis -> TTS -> Response.
knowledge_agent_client: Manages the interaction with the LLM, including prompt construction and JSON extraction.
extract_json_from_text: A robust parser that cleans raw LLM output (removing markdown, fixing trailing commas) to extract valid JSON.
determine_agent_goal: Implements the logic for the Goal-Based Agent, deciding whether to focus on "Anxiety Reduction" or "Fluency Shaping".
tts_router: Intelligently routes TTS requests to either Kokoro (for high-quality English) or Edge-TTS (for other languages), handling voice selection and fallbacks.
extract_acoustic_features: Computes RMS, ZCR, Variance, and Pitch from raw numpy audio arrays.
decode_audio_fallback: Uses system FFmpeg via subprocess to decode audio if the primary library fails.
check_and_download_models: Ensures required model files (ONNX) are present on startup.
